Practical Test on 20/04/2022

Hello,
This repository includes code of the custom plugin named as Liberty Books.

In the practical test, I need to make a plugin kind of searching tool for custom post type called as 'Book'.

For frontend, I have made a shortcode named as 'search_books', By integrating this shortcode in frontend you will find the whole functionaltiy there.

Thank You.
